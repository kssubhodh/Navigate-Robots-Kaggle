# Navigate-Robots-Kaggle
This is a classification problem. Here the task is to identify which of the nine types of surface a robot is travelling on based on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors) containing attributes related to acceleration and angular velocities.

Performed Detailed EDA and built a first cut solution using XG boosted classifier and random forest regressor.

I have also written a blog explaining steps to perform EDA using this project as an example.
